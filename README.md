I don't use this recipe, and as a result it's essentially unmaintained. I'd be happy to let someone who is more invested fork it and be the source of truth, just let me know.

The JetBrains recipes require [this repo](https://github.com/autopkg/mosen-recipes) in your autopkg path.

Docker for Mac beta pkg recipe requires [this repo](https://github.com/autopkg/homebysix-recipes) in your autopkg path.
